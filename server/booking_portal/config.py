# in the order in which they are mentioned below For eg. first FESEM instrument
#  will be registered on portal then TCSPC and so on
#
# New instruments should be appended at the last of the list

# NOTE: This is a very, very brittle way of doing things. They key for
# `form_template_dict` is the primary key of the 'Instrument' model. An
# alternative method needs to be found.
